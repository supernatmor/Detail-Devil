# detaildevil
This is the final result of our 3rd group project in the UNCC Coding Boot Camp.


The purpose of the webpage is to connect vehicle owners with local auto detailers.
After creating an account, the user will be able to search through our list of vendors, select a package and time for service, then
proceed to the final step where the payment information is handled and the appointment is booked.
